I enjoyed developing library project in dart. that manage a library book inventory and user interactions.

The main functions in this project are:
1. **Let user Add New Book**
2. **Let user delete Book**
3. **Let user edit Book information**
4. **Let user query Books**
5. **The user can purchase a book and then the invoice details will be shown to him/her**
Secondary objective:
1. **Let user view all Book Categories and then choes one of them to view books related to chosen categorie**

2. **the user can view number of purchases**

## Project outputs:
First, if the user choose "1" then all Categories displayed.
