# Project #1 - Library Project using Dart
In this project i made a simple library management system that has a lot of services like adding a book or deleting,
-first of all i wanted the services that change the data of the system seperated from the other services so i made two users Admin or a client
and because this is not a real life application i made the password ='1234' easily accessed just for testing the app.
- all the choices in the application are choosen by entering a number.
- you can add multiable catagories when adding a book and when you are finished just press 'q'.
